# mcp-project-orchestrator

## Overview

The mcp-project-orchestrator is an MCP server designed to assist with the orchestration of new software projects by applying standardized templates and best practices in design patterns and software architecture.

This server extracts key information from user input, selects an appropriate project template from a standardized catalogue (with consistent structure for both project and component templates), and generates comprehensive documentation that includes:

- Software Architecture
- Components and Modules
- File Structures and Directory Trees
- Implementation Strategies
- Visual diagrams using the Mermaid tool

## Key Features

- **Standardized Templates:** All project and component templates follow a consistent structure with standardized keys (e.g., 'name', 'type', 'mermaid', 'directory_structure').
- **Redundancy Elimination:** Redundant or overlapping templates have been consolidated or removed to keep the catalogue clean and configurable.
- **Dynamic Configuration:** The server loads its configuration from `project_orchestration.json`, which contains MCP-specific settings such as communication protocols and compliance standards.
- **Documentation Generation:** Automatically generated comprehensive README files and Mermaid diagrams help visualize the project architecture and implementation strategy.

## How It Works

1. **Information Extraction:** The server analyzes the user's project idea to extract design patterns and architecture concepts.
2. **Template Selection:** Based on the analysis, an appropriate project template is selected from a standardized catalogue (e.g., Microservices Architecture, Event-Driven, Repository Pattern, etc.).
3. **Project Setup:** The server creates the project directory structure and placeholder files based on the chosen template. It populates component files (interfaces, implementations, tests, etc.) with TODO comments, ensuring consistent naming and file organization.
4. **Documentation and Visualization:** The server generates a comprehensive README with details about the software architecture, components, process flows, file structures, and implementation strategy, including visual diagrams generated by the Mermaid tool.

## Configuration

The server loads its configuration from `project_orchestration.json`, which contains settings such as:

- Communication Protocol: JSON-RPC
- MCP Compliance: true
- Steps for orchestration and orchestration guidelines

This configuration is attached to the FastMCP instance as `mcp.config`.

## Usage

To run the MCP server, execute:

```bash
python project_orchestration.py
```

Ensure that the required JSON template files (e.g., `project_templates.json`, `component_templates.json`, and `project_orchestration.json`) are present in the workspace.

## Extending the Server

Developers can extend or modify the orchestration process by:

- Updating the standardized templates (both project and component templates) to change the structure or add new keys as needed.
- Modifying `project_orchestration.json` to update configuration details and orchestration steps.
- Customizing the MCP orchestration logic in `project_orchestration.py` to refine project and documentation generation.
